What i should do from now on?
-----------------------------
   Lately, i Feel nervous about forgetting things, and feel not im that good.
      while, In fact i recognize myself as someone who can solve things what any thing required.
   but that never changes that, i feel also something loosing.

   Recently i read 2 books,(1 is on reading state actually.)
   i'm feeling that i should do more better and simple in not lazy way.
      in book, lazy is good because of design by contract.
      but im developer who writes them.
      so i should not.

   i think i need to follow something more **practical practice for this long journey.**
