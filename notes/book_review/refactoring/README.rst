   Refactoring is first refered by *smalltalk* community and became powerful.
      - Refactoring is essential to *framework development.*
      - Framework devs knows their product will not be that perfact in early days.
      - Framework devs convince that they will be more often to read and fix the code rather than writing them.
   So, It's important to write code easy to understand and easy to modify.
   main key of them is *refactoring.*
   for general software and even more to framework codes.

   Refactoring is a thing, which is follwed by major risks.
   Refactoring is modifing the code, so subtle bugs can be occured.
   If refactoring was done under wrong process, long days of efforts can be ruined.
   Without formal and contentful practices, that is something dangerous.

   There's some people who analyze the code by their own intuition,
   As they work processes, there will be more to modify.
   If we wishes not to make those mistakes, **Refactoring should occur under complete plan and also with pragmatical tools.**

   This book introduces refactoring principles and some good habits also.
   Each chapter describes trusted process and backgrounds about reason why refactoring is needed at the specific moments.
   above them will be trite technics, like *extracting method* and *moving field.*

   But we should careful!
   Just only to **Understand Each Technic's Process will offer us Systematic and Refined Refactoring!**

   I first experienced Refined Refactoring by single work at one level with doing so with Kent Beck.
   A habits learned at those days gave me real good helps.
   **Convinced and destressed was what i felt.**
