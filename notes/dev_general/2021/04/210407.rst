What I Did today
----------------

- read *"The Pracgmatic Programms",* from chapter 5 to 5.28.
   5: Bend or Break
      5.28: temporal couplig
- read *Pro Git*

Plan on next day
----------------

- Read from start of book "The C Programming language" by K&R For reason to solve the practices as a big project to master.
   1. Make Project in c-books-KnR as Practices
   #. Make some milestones of that project. Chapter by chapter.
   #. Make issue for each practice, and make them to cover the milestone

Why read Pro git at this point?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   Despite of my ability, I found understand deeply to entire software program is best way to keep myself at good state.
   So, I'm planning to have my work flow just to fit perfectly, so that my workflow explains the git(as VCS)'s own philosophy.
   I started reading the from start Preface from 2 author.
      Becuase programming abillity is not just depend on Formulas but rather to Insight and Sevice Design ability.
   I think i would not summarize git's content. it would be better to act and Acquire those ability.
