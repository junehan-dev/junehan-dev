Why I did quit writing blog?
----------------------------
   Just like too much document does harm the software develop itself's originality,
   My writings from other sources is either.
   I wanted writing to be clean and just a fact and occurences also.
   blog was reWriting the other's writings.

how to Refactor easy and how to approach?
-----------------------------------------
   Refactoring requires **Persistency.**
   Persist actions of refactoring means actual how easy is to approach the code modifing action.(also reading)

   If legacy is complex,
      It will be hard to refactor the whole structure.
      And Refactor not in all at once means breaking the consistency.
   Refactoring by small partial will disturb me keep refactoring.
   There are some rule to figure out this problem.
      - **Do it from frequently action code.**
      - **Do not refactor perfectly to be unmatch to others**
      - **Keep refactoring with versions of step by step**
      - **Someone could tell me Its not refactored. Ignore and follow the product.**
      - **Keep in my that you are professional and follow the Great.**
