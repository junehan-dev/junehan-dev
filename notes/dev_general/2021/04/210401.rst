About How Programmer grows
--------------------------

*Hubert Dreyfus* Divides getting skill process by 3.
their main cores are,
   1. **Rule**
   2. **Maxim**
   3. **Intuition**

Just as books I am reading and read and also between What I experiencing and planning,
I recognized that i'm always in forgetting process even especially when i'm in learning process.
Guess i'm afraid of things as i learn and time passes.

In preface of book *The Practical Programmer,*
korean translator said::

   In Developer community, there is big hole between rule and Intuition. 
   First joining is easy, there's lots of sources.
   At contrast, There is people who are at the level of master.
   Their actions are mostly based on intuition, so they all not well to explain them.

But i felt little suspicious about this comment.
If i become real good, I should guarantee and able to say,

   - What i am doing?
   - Why i do this at this moment?
   - What i am going to do after this?

and vise versa, i understand why he told this to publics.

So these books are Important.
To Keep me stay tight to be dreamer and Ideal for long.
